# Biomarkers_for_Peri-Implantitis
This repository contains the data analysis pipeline for the proteomic analysis of crevicular fluid for the identification of biomarker panels for diagnostics of peri-implantitis. Three cohorts of patients with peri-implantitis-affected implants, healthy implants, and healthy teeth were processed. <br/>

Here you find the rmd files for the analysis of the discovery, validation and external validation cohorts, and for the identification and validation of biomarker panels using classification models.
